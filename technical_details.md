## Back-End

The website is served by an Apache 2.0 server, running on an Ubuntu 16.04 OS hosted by Digital Ocean. It uses a Django framework which implements a model-template-view pattern that links together a number of Python scripts and a SQLite database, to render all pages transmitted to the end-user via HTTP. 

## Front-End

In its Front-End, the website uses Bootstrap 3.0 to create a responsive experience. Moreover, the JQuery library,  which is required by Bootstrap, is used to simplify the coding of number of AJAX calls. No other JavaScript libraries are used.
